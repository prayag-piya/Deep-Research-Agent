They have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and handle diverse input modalities. In this section, we will delve into the transformer architecture, its key components, and its applications in computer vision and natural language processing.\n\nThe Transformer Architecture\n\nThe transformer architecture was first introduced in the paper 'Attention Is All You Need' by Vaswani et al. in 2017. It is based on the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of each word or token in a sequence relative to others, regardless of their positional distance. This is achieved through the scaled dot-product attention mechanism, which computes a representation of each word by considering the entire sequence.\n\nKey Components of Transformers\n\n1.  Self-Attention Mechanism: The self-attention mechanism is the core component of transformers. It allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and handle diverse input modalities. The scaled dot-product attention mechanism is particularly efficient and effective in capturing relationships between words within a sequence.\n\n2.  Multi-Head Attention: Transformers employ multi-head attention, where multiple self-attention mechanisms run in parallel at each layer. This allows the model to focus on different parts of the sequence simultaneously, enhancing its ability to capture a variety of dependencies.\n\n3.  Positional Encoding: The positional encoding is used to preserve the order of tokens in the input sequence. It adds a fixed-length vector to each token, allowing the model to maintain the context of the sequence.\n\nApplications of Transformers\n\nTransformers have been applied successfully in various computer vision and natural language processing tasks, including image classification, object detection, and machine translation. They have also shown promise in handling diverse input modalities, such as visual data, non-visual data, and multimodal fusion.\n\nVision Transformers (ViT)\n\nThe Vision Transformer (ViT) is a specific type of transformer architecture designed for computer vision tasks. It treats image patches as sequence elements and uses self-attention mechanisms to capture relationships between pixels in the input image. ViT has shown state-of-the-art performance in various computer vision benchmarks, including image classification and object detection.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Vaswani et al., 'Attention Is All You Need', 2017.\n\n[2] Devlin et al., 'Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding', 2019.\n\n[3] Dosovitskiy et al., 'An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale', 2020.\n\n", "reference": [{"id": 1, "title": "Attention Is All You Need", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762"}, {"id": 2, "title": "Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04424"}]}, {"id": 5, "section": "Transformers in Computer Vision", "content": "...", "reference": [{"id": 70, "title": "How Do Transformers Handle Long-Range Dependencies?", "url": "https://eureka.patsnap.com/article/how-do-transformers-handle-long-range-dependencies"}, {"id": 71, "title": "Self-Attention in Vision Transformers: Why It Captures Long-Range Dependencies", "url": "https://eureka.patsnap.com/article/self-attention-in-vision-transformers-why-it-captures-long-range-dependencies"}, {"id": 72, "title": "Advances on Multimodal Remote Sensing Foundation Models for Visual Question Answering", "url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/17/21/3532"}, {"id": 73, "title": "Vision Transformers for Image Classification", "url": "https://arxiv.org/html/2410.16602v3"}, {"id": 74, "title": "Transformer-XL: Long-Short Term Memory Recurrent Units for Vision Transformer Models", "url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11858.pdf"}]}]
