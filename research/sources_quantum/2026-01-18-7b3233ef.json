To achieve longer distances, Los Alamos researchers developed a free-space quantum cryptography system that could send keys through the air. Los Alamos quantum scientists developed a transportable, self-contained QKD system that used polarized photons to send information through the air for distances of up to 10 miles.

If anyone tries to intercept or measure those keys, the quantum state changes \u2014 immediately alerting both sides that the channel has been compromised. Here's my Analogy: Imagine mailing something fragile such as a glass sculpture. If the package arrives cracked, you know someone tampered with it.

In accordance with this principle, we have been a strong proponent of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) for years, starting with our early experiments in Chrome in 2016. At present, we are actively rolling out the PQC algorithms standardized by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as our primary quantum-safe technology. Our focus is on solutions that are secure, scalable, and ready for both today's and tomorrow's challenges. [...] While PQC is our chosen path forward, it is not the only technology being discussed for a quantum-resistant future. Another approach that has gained attention is Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). As part of our commitment to thorough research and providing the best security for our users, we have closely evaluated QKD. In this post, we will share our assessment of the QKD technology and explain why we believe PQC is the more mature and scalable solution for our needs.",

This decision has implications far beyond the research sector: it marks the beginning of a global transition to new cryptosystems. Major technology providers such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have already begun to align their security protocols with these new standards.

In the case of electronic-structure simulations, quantum defect embedding theory is a framework that bridges the gap between small numbers of Qbits and large numbers of atoms in a typical materials system. In this talk, I will illustrate its application to a Frenkel-Davydov Hamiltonian used to model excitonic effects in organic solids and to a coupled-cluster approach to simulate near-surface oxygen vacancies in \u03b1-Al2O3. Studies on quantum simulators show promising results and noise is the limiting factor when running on real IBM quantum",

        "content": "In semiconductor AQS with gated quantum dots, gates are used to tune the quantum dots and the coupling between the dots, an important advantage. Although one-dimensional gated structures and quasi-two-dimensional structures can be fabricated with quantum dots, two-dimensional structures with both internal sites and edge sites can only be realized by dopant placement. Three dimensional arrays of perfectly placed dopants can be envisioned. This means that dopant arrays could be a faithful analog for a wider range of materials and physics problems. [...] We have fabricated 3 \u00d7 3 arrays of single/few-dopant quantum dots with finite disorder and demonstrated tuning of the electron ensemble using gates and probed the many-body states using quantum transport measurements. We define the electron ensemble in the array by tuning the chemical potential landscape using in-plane gates and measure the low-temperature quantum transport through the array to probe the charge addition spectrum, resonant tunneling, and the impact of inhomogeneity within the many-body system of the arrays. By controlling the lattice constants, we tune the hopping amplitude and long-range Coulomb interactions and observe the finite-size analogue of a transition from metallic to Mott insulating behavior. We have simulated thermally activated hopping and Hubbard band [...] In the last fifteen years there has been much activity using trapped ultracold atoms and ions, and superconducting circuits to do analog quantum simulation. Although impressive results have been obtained, the physical realization of these AQSs uses atoms to represent electrons, invents artificial interactions to model real interactions, and works at energy scales too hot to model material effects of interest. Recently semiconductor quantum dot arrays and precisely placed dopants in Si have been used for analog quantum simulations of Hubbard models. In semiconductor AQSs, the quantum simulator is a faithful representation of the materials of interest: electrons are used to simulate electronic materials, the real interactions are used, and the energy scales are the same as in the materials",
